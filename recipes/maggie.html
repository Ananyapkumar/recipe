          until they become soft and tender. While the noodles are cooking, you can optionally add some chopped vegetables like carrots, peas, or bell peppers to the boiling water.

Cook for another minute or two, stirring occasionally, until the water evaporates, and the noodles absorb the flavors. Your delicious plate of

        cheese if you like.</p>
